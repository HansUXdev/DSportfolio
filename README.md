# About
This repo is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks to show off as a portfolio of work related to Data Science, Quantitative Fincance, Machine Learning and AI. 

# [Roadmap](https://github.com/users/HansUXdev/projects/1/views/2)
Check out the roadmap to get a better idea of where individual projects within my portfolio are.
Generally speaking, if its in backlog, I've either not started with the project or just haven't published to github because my code is garbage or I'm unsure if I want to make it public for legal/financial reasons. If its in "review", it means, I'm reasonably confident that it's worth showing a potential employer, friend, business partner, and would LOVE some feedback on from any of the people who have cloned this repo (i do watch my insights).
