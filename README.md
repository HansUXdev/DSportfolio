# About
This repo is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks to show off as a portfolio of work related to Data Science, Quantitative Fincance, Machine Learning and AI. 

# [Roadmap](https://github.com/users/HansUXdev/projects/1/views/2)
Check out the roadmap to get a better idea of where individual projects within my portfolio are.
Generally speaking, if its in backlog, I've either not started with the project or just haven't published to github because my code is garbage or I'm unsure if I want to make it public for legal/financial reasons. If its in "review", it means, I'm reasonably confident that it's worth showing a potential employer, friend, business partner, and would LOVE some feedback on from any of the people who have cloned this repo (i do watch my insights). 

# Personal Philosophy and approach to Quantative Finance
It's my personal belief that any well managed Quantitative Portfolio, should be ACTIVELY managed, semi-automatously and think in term of **_Recursive Investing_**. Moreover, it should be well diversified with correlated assets and uncorrected assets, and attempt to seek both income and growth regardless of market conditions. Each segment, using machine learning, forecasting and automated risk management is absultely essential in this approach. Understanding this, is what makes the difference between millions and billions...

For example,
- **Bonds** should be held to produces _currencies_, which are held and borrowed against for living expenses.
- **Currencies**, should be weighted based on the individuals home nations, the nations they do business with, and should be multiplied based on macro economics, and arbitrage.
- **Dividends**, should NOT be DRIPPED, they should be used to cover the risk of margin trades, or reinvested into growth, so as to outpace, the potential decay.
- **Growth Stocks**, should fall into 2 categories, those with divided and those that are speculative.
- **Options**, should be sold, rather than bought. We're not gamblers, we're investors... Sell to the degens and make the market, rather then being played by it. 
- **Real Estate**, should be invested in by borrowing against a well managed portfolio of the above assets. It goes without saying, that real estate is great for both income and growth. More importantly, however, real estate is ultimately about investing in _communities, people and the commons_. Tax liens, are a third way to invest into real estate, which is far to commonly overlooked. Finally, which a property is nearing paid off, or when interest rates have flipped into a decline, the loans should be refinanced to invest into the assets mentioned above. In this final segment, we start all over again and complete the recursive loop.
