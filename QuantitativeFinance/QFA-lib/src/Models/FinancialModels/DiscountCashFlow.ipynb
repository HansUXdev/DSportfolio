    "# Discount Cash Flow Calculation\n",
    "This Python script performs a financial valuation of a company (in this case, with the ticker symbol 'AAPL') using discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **fetch_financial_data(ticker)**:\n",
    "   - This function takes a ticker symbol as input and attempts to fetch financial data using the Yahoo Finance API (`yf.Ticker(ticker)`).\n",
    "   - It retrieves the company's cash flow statement and extracts the free cash flow.\n",
    "   - It also obtains the number of outstanding shares of the company.\n",
    "   - Any errors encountered during this process are handled and appropriate error messages are printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **calculate_cashflow_growth_rate(free_cash_flows)**:\n",
    "   - This function calculates the average annual growth rate of free cash flows using percentage change.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **project_future_free_cash_flows(last_cash_flow, growth_rate, years)**:\n",
    "   - Given the last observed free cash flow, growth rate, and a specified number of years, this function projects future free cash flows using a compounding growth formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **discount_cash_flows(future_cash_flows, required_rate)**:\n",
    "   - This function discounts the projected future cash flows back to their present value using a discount factor based on the required rate of return (WACC).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **calculate_terminal_value(last_cash_flow, growth_rate, required_rate, years)**:\n",
    "   - It calculates the terminal value of the company, representing its value beyond the explicit forecast period, using the Gordon Growth Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **calculate_fair_value(discounted_cash_flows, terminal_value, outstanding_shares)**:\n",
    "   - This function computes the fair value per share by summing the present values of discounted future cash flows and the terminal value, then dividing by the total number of outstanding shares.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **main()**:\n",
    "   - Sets up parameters such as the required rate of return, perpetual growth rate, and the number of years to project.\n",
    "   - Calls the above functions in sequence to perform the valuation.\n",
    "   - Prints out the fair value per share of the company based on the DCF analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script provides a basic framework for valuing a company's stock by estimating its future cash flows and discounting them back to their present value, accounting for both the explicit forecast period and the terminal value.\n",
