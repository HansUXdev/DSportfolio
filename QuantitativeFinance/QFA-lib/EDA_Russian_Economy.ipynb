    "# Problem Statement and Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "As of 2024, the Russian economy is facing significant strain due to a range of geopolitical and economic factors. While it continues to function under heavy international sanctions, state control over major financial institutions, and the establishment of parallel import systems (in collaboration with nations like China, India, and Turkey), several economic risks are emerging. These risks include unprecedented levels of **capital flight**, **inflation**, severe **labor market constraints** due to military mobilization, and an over-dependence on **oil exports** in a volatile global energy market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Russia's fiscal health is being severely compromised by disproportionate **military spending**, which has surged to nearly **6% of GDP**. This defense expenditure is squeezing out critical spending on social welfare and infrastructure, leading to growing inefficiencies in non-defense sectors&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. Furthermore, the exodus of skilled labor, driven by both emigration and military conscription, has damaged key sectors like technology and manufacturing, limiting long-term growth potential&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given these conditions, this **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** aims to investigate whether these factors could precipitate a collapse of the Russian economy, similar to the 1998 financial crisis. It will explore whether **economic indicators** suggest that a collapse is inevitable or if other mitigating factors, such as parallel markets and state control of financial institutions, might delay or prevent it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Analyze the Impact of Military Spending, Sanctions, and State Control on Economic Stability**\n",
    "Russia's massive military expenditure (39% of the Kremlin's budget) has created fiscal imbalances that are weakening its economic foundations&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. Sanctions have deprived Russia of access to global financial markets, forcing the government to rely on domestic financial institutions. This objective will examine:\n",
    "- How these expenditures affect long-term fiscal health.\n",
    "- The role of state-controlled financial institutions in managing these economic pressures.\n",
    "- How sanctions targeting specific sectors (e.g., energy, technology) are amplifying fiscal and economic risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Examine the Effects of Capital Flight and Talent Drain in the Context of Sanctions**\n",
    "Since the invasion of Ukraine, Russia has experienced an exodus of capital and skilled workers. **Private capital outflows have reached a record $253 billion**&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}, and the country has lost a substantial portion of its tech workforce. This objective will focus on:\n",
    "- Quantifying the scale of capital flight and assessing its impact on the Russian financial system.\n",
    "- Investigating the labor market effects of talent drain, including wage inflation, skills shortages, and the impact on key industries.\n",
    "- Understanding how currency controls and sanctions are altering the nature of capital flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Investigate the Relationship Between Oil Prices, Inflation, Exchange Rate Volatility, and Sovereign Debt**\n",
    "Russia’s economy is highly dependent on oil exports, and global oil price fluctuations significantly impact its fiscal balance. In combination with high inflation and volatile exchange rates, the country faces growing sovereign debt risks. This objective will:\n",
    "- Analyze the relationship between **oil prices** and Russia’s fiscal health, including **debt-to-GDP** ratios.\n",
    "- Track the impact of inflation on wages, consumer spending, and the broader economy.\n",
    "- Measure currency volatility against major global currencies (USD, CNY, EUR) and assess how this volatility signals economic distress.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Explore the Role of Parallel Markets and the Impact of Sanctions on Russian Trade Flows**\n",
    "Despite sanctions, Russia has maintained trade relationships with China, India, Turkey, and other nations through parallel markets. This objective will assess:\n",
    "- How parallel import systems are enabling Russia to circumvent Western sanctions.\n",
    "- The sustainability of these trade flows and whether they provide a buffer against economic collapse.\n",
    "- The impact of sanctions on key industries such as energy, technology, and defense.\n"

    "# 2. Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Data collection for this EDA will focus on gathering both historical and real-time data across several key economic indicators that are critical to assessing the current state and potential collapse of the Russian economy. Each dataset will be sourced from reliable international institutions, government bodies, and financial platforms. Below is a detailed breakdown of the sources, variables, and rationale for their inclusion.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Government Spending and Fiscal Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Sources**:\n",
    "- **World Bank**: Provides comprehensive macroeconomic data, including historical data on **government debt**, **fiscal deficits**, and **GDP growth**. These indicators are essential for assessing Russia’s fiscal health and its ability to sustain heavy military spending.\n",
    "- **IMF (International Monetary Fund)**: Offers detailed fiscal reports that provide insights into Russia's budget allocations, **military spending**, and the long-term sustainability of its **debt-to-GDP ratio**.\n",
    "- **Russia’s Ministry of Finance**: Official reports detailing budgetary decisions, including **military expenditures**, allocations for social welfare, and fiscal deficit management strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Variables**:\n",
    "- **Military Spending as a Percentage of GDP**: Russia's military expenditure, currently at 6% of GDP, is a critical indicator of fiscal strain. This variable will track whether Russia can sustain such high levels of defense spending while maintaining economic stability.\n",
    "- **Budget Deficits**: The size of Russia’s deficit, driven largely by war spending, can signal fiscal imbalance and potential economic collapse. This variable will help assess whether the government is financing the war effort through debt accumulation.\n",
    "- **Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio**: Tracking the growth in Russia’s government debt relative to its GDP provides insights into the country’s long-term debt sustainability. A sharp increase could indicate an unsustainable fiscal path.\n",

    "## 2. Currency Exchange Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Sources**:\n",
    "- **Forex APIs (e.g., `yfinance`, `alpha_vantage`)**: These APIs offer real-time and historical exchange rate data, allowing for the tracking of **ruble depreciation** against major global currencies like the **USD**, **EUR**, **CNY**, and **INR**.\n",
    "- **Central Bank of Russia**: Reports on currency interventions and exchange rate management strategies. This will help assess how the central bank is trying to stabilize the ruble amid sanctions and capital controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Currency Pairs**:\n",
    "- **RUB/USD (Russian Ruble vs. US Dollar)**: As the most significant global reserve currency, the dollar serves as a baseline for the ruble's global value. Significant depreciation of the ruble against the dollar could signal impending capital flight or economic instability.\n",
    "- **RUB/CNY (Ruble vs. Chinese Yuan)**: Given Russia’s pivot to China for trade and technology amid Western sanctions, this pair will track the strength of the ruble relative to China’s economy, which is a key economic partner.\n",
    "- **RUB/INR (Ruble vs. Indian Rupee)**: India remains one of Russia’s largest buyers of oil, and this currency pair reflects the health of trade relations.\n",
    "- **RUB/EUR (Ruble vs. Euro)**: Although heavily sanctioned, Russia maintains indirect trade relationships with Europe via intermediaries like Turkey and Kazakhstan. Monitoring the ruble against the euro will provide insights into European demand for Russian energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Variables**:\n",
    "- **Exchange Rates**: The performance of the ruble against other currencies is a direct reflection of investor confidence, capital flight, and the impact of sanctions. Any sharp depreciation would be a signal of stress in the Russian economy.\n",
    "- **Volatility**: Currency volatility, calculated through rolling standard deviations, provides insights into financial instability. High volatility may reflect uncertainty due to sanctions or capital flight risks.\n",

    "\n",
    "Data preprocessing is a critical step in preparing the collected data for analysis. It ensures that all datasets are consistent, reliable, and ready for feature engineering and modeling. This section outlines the steps involved in cleaning, transforming, and structuring the data so that it can be effectively used in the exploratory analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Handling Missing Data for Macroeconomic Indicators**:\n",
    "   - **Overview**: Macroeconomic data from sources like the **World Bank**, **IMF**, and **Russian Ministry of Finance** may contain missing values for specific time periods due to data reporting gaps, sanctions, or geopolitical disruptions. Missing data could skew the analysis, so it is important to handle these gaps systematically.\n",
    "   - **Approach**:\n",
    "     - **Interpolation**: For time-series data (e.g., debt, GDP, inflation), use **linear interpolation** to estimate missing values based on surrounding data points. This method is useful when the missing data points are few and scattered.\n",
    "     - **Forward Fill or Backward Fill**: In cases where data is missing for longer periods, use forward or backward fill techniques to propagate the last known value. This can be done using `pandas` in Python, e.g., `df.fillna(method='ffill')`.\n",
    "     - **Dropping Missing Values**: If a large proportion of data is missing for a particular variable, it may be necessary to drop those rows or columns if interpolation is not suitable. For categorical data like **sanctions**, missing entries might be removed if they don't impact the overall trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Formatting Exchange Rate and Capital Outflow Data for Consistency**:\n",
    "   - **Overview**: Currency exchange rate and capital outflow data may come in different formats and frequencies (e.g., daily vs. monthly data). These need to be aligned so that they can be used in time-series analysis.\n",
    "   - **Approach**:\n",
    "     - **Resampling Data**: Use `pandas` to standardize data to the same time interval, whether that is daily, weekly, or monthly. For instance, resample daily exchange rate data into monthly averages to match the frequency of capital outflow data: \n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       df_resampled = df.resample('M').mean()  # Resampling to monthly data\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "     - **Converting Currencies**: If data for capital flight is reported in multiple currencies (e.g., USD, EUR), convert them into a common currency (e.g., RUB) using exchange rate data at the relevant time intervals. This ensures uniformity in the analysis of capital outflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Handling Outliers**:\n",
    "   - **Overview**: Sudden spikes or drops in variables like **oil prices**, **exchange rates**, or **capital flight** can occur due to geopolitical events, sanctions, or global market volatility. These outliers may distort the analysis if not properly handled.\n",
    "   - **Approach**:\n",
    "     - **Z-Score Analysis**: Use **Z-scores** to detect outliers that deviate significantly from the mean. Data points with Z-scores beyond a threshold (e.g., ±3) can be flagged for further investigation.\n",
    "     - **Capping**: In cases where outliers are extreme but not erroneous, cap the values at a specific percentile (e.g., the 1st and 99th percentiles) to minimize their effect on the overall analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering involves creating new, informative features from the existing data to uncover deeper patterns and trends. These features will help analyze the complexities of the Russian economy in the context of capital flight, sanctions, and currency depreciation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Year-on-Year Growth Rates for Debt, Inflation, Oil Prices, and Capital Flight**:\n",
    "   - **Overview**: Growth rates help measure the magnitude of changes in key economic variables and can highlight trends of deterioration or recovery.\n",
    "   - **Approach**:\n",
    "     - **Formula**: \n",
    "       \\[\n",
    "       \\text{YoY Growth Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Current Period Value} - \\text{Previous Period Value}}{\\text{Previous Period Value}} \\times 100\n",
    "       \\]\n",
    "     - **Implementation**: Use Python's `pandas` library to calculate these growth rates for variables like **GDP**, **inflation**, **debt**, and **capital flight**. Example:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       df['growth_rate'] = df['value'].pct_change(periods=12) * 100\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "     - **Purpose**: Year-on-year growth rates will help identify rapid increases in **inflation**, **debt accumulation**, or **capital outflows**, signaling potential economic crises.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Oil Dependency Ratio**:\n",
    "   - **Overview**: Russia’s economy is heavily reliant on oil and gas exports, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil prices. This feature measures the extent of this dependency.\n",
    "   - **Formula**: \n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{Oil Dependency Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Oil Revenue}}{\\text{Total Government Revenue}} \\times 100\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: A high oil dependency ratio will indicate that Russia’s economy is particularly vulnerable to falling oil prices or sanctions targeting energy exports.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Inflation-Adjusted Wages**:\n",
    "   - **Overview**: Inflation-adjusted wages (real wages) provide insights into the purchasing power of Russian citizens, particularly under the strain of inflation.\n",
    "   - **Formula**: \n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{Real Wage} = \\frac{\\text{Nominal Wage}}{1 + \\text{Inflation Rate}}\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   - **Implementation**: Use inflation data from **Rosstat** and wage data to calculate inflation-adjusted wages. This helps understand the impact of rising prices on consumers' ability to afford basic goods and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Currency Volatility**:\n",
    "   - **Overview**: Volatility is a measure of the risk or uncertainty associated with currency fluctuations. High volatility in the ruble signals financial instability, which can trigger capital flight.\n",
    "   - **Approach**:\n",
    "     - **Rolling Standard Deviation**: Calculate the rolling standard deviation of the ruble's exchange rate over a specific window (e.g., 30 days or 90 days) to measure currency volatility:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       df['volatility'] = df['exchange_rate'].rolling(window=30).std()\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "     - **Purpose**: Volatility is often correlated with investor sentiment and geopolitical events. A spike in ruble volatility could indicate rising risks of capital flight or financial instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Handling Categorical Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical data, such as sanctions and geopolitical events, needs to be converted into numerical representations that can be used in statistical models and machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Classifying Sanctions Data Based on Severity and Economic Impact**:\n",
    "   - **Overview**: Sanctions vary in severity and impact depending on which sectors (e.g., energy, banking, technology) they target. This information must be quantified for analysis.\n",
    "   - **Approach**:\n",
    "     - **Sanction Severity Categories**: Categorize sanctions based on their scope and effect:\n",
    "       - **Mild**: Restrictions on luxury goods, minor industries.\n",
    "       - **Moderate**: Targeting key sectors like energy or finance, but with exceptions for humanitarian purposes.\n",
    "       - **Severe**: Full embargoes on energy exports, access to financial systems (e.g., SWIFT).\n",
    "     - **One-Hot Encoding**: Use one-hot encoding to convert these categories into numerical features that can be analyzed in models. For instance:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['sanction_severity'])\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Geopolitical Events**:\n",
    "   - **Overview**: Significant geopolitical events, such as military escalations or peace negotiations, can have an immediate impact on financial markets, exchange rates, and capital flows.\n",
    "   - **Approach**:\n",
    "     - **Sentiment Analysis**: Assign a **sentiment score** to major geopolitical events based on news articles and reports. Use NLP tools like `vaderSentiment` to quantify whether an event is perceived positively, negatively, or neutrally.\n",
    "     - **Event Labeling**: Create labels for major geopolitical events (e.g., \"Sanctions Imposed,\" \"Military Mobilization\") and use them as categorical variables to analyze their short-term effects on the economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This data preprocessing framework will ensure that the datasets are clean, consistent, and ready for feature extraction and analysis. By engineering key features like year-on-year growth rates, oil dependency ratios, and currency volatility, we will be able to uncover important trends and patterns that provide insights into Russia’s economic vulnerabilities.\n"

    "## 1. Summary Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overview**:\n",
    "- The goal of summary statistics is to provide basic insights into the collected data, such as the average levels of key indicators, the degree of variability, and any skewness in the distribution.\n",
    "- For each dataset (e.g., **GDP**, **military spending**, **inflation**, **exchange rates**, **oil prices**), the following summary statistics will be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Metrics**:\n",
    "1. **Mean**:\n",
    "   - The **mean** represents the average value of a variable over a defined period. For instance, it can reveal the average inflation rate or average exchange rate of the ruble against the dollar over a specified timeframe.\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: This helps to identify normal levels for key variables such as inflation, GDP, or debt.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     df['inflation'].mean()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Median**:\n",
    "   - The **median** is the middle value when the data is ordered. It is less sensitive to extreme outliers than the mean and provides a more robust measure of central tendency.\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: If the median inflation rate is much lower than the mean, this could indicate that a few high inflationary spikes are skewing the average, potentially due to sanctions or geopolitical shocks.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Standard Deviation (SD)**:\n",
    "   - **Standard deviation** measures the amount of variation or dispersion in a dataset.\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: A high SD in variables like **oil prices** or **exchange rates** would indicate large fluctuations, signaling market volatility and economic instability. A high SD for **wage growth** or **inflation** would highlight economic pressures.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     df['exchange_rate'].std()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Variance**:\n",
    "   - Variance measures the spread of data points from the mean. It provides another measure of volatility in economic indicators.\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Variance is particularly useful in understanding the spread of values in highly volatile datasets like **currency exchange rates** or **oil prices**.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Skewness**:\n",
    "   - **Skewness** indicates whether the distribution of the data is symmetric or skewed towards the higher or lower end.\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: A highly skewed distribution of **capital flight** data, for example, might suggest sporadic but large outflows in response to major geopolitical events, while otherwise remaining low.\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. **Kurtosis**:\n",
    "   - **Kurtosis** measures the “tailedness” of the data. A higher kurtosis indicates heavy tails, meaning more extreme values than expected.\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: In the context of **oil prices** or **inflation**, a high kurtosis value would indicate frequent extreme fluctuations, which might signal economic fragility.\n",
    "   \n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Correlation Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overview**:\n",
    "- A **correlation matrix** will be used to analyze the relationships between key variables. This will help identify which factors are closely related and may have predictive power over one another. For example, the correlation between **oil prices** and **government revenue** or between **currency volatility** and **capital flight** can offer insights into how these factors interact.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### **Metrics**:\n",
    "1. **Pearson Correlation Coefficient**:\n",
    "   - Measures the linear correlation between two variables. The result will range from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation).\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Determine the strength and direction of relationships between variables like **oil prices** and **ruble exchange rates**, or **capital flight** and **inflation**. For instance, a high negative correlation between ruble depreciation and capital flight would suggest that as the ruble weakens, capital outflows increase.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     df.corr(method='pearson')\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Correlations to Analyze:\n",
    "1. **Oil Prices vs. GDP**:\n",
    "   - A positive correlation is expected as oil exports are a major source of revenue for Russia. A drop in oil prices would likely coincide with a drop in GDP.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Military Spending vs. Budget Deficit**:\n",
    "   - This correlation will likely be positive, as increased military spending exacerbates the budget deficit, especially given Russia's current fiscal conditions&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Inflation vs. Real Wages**:\n",
    "   - A negative correlation is expected, as inflation erodes the purchasing power of nominal wages, resulting in a drop in real wages.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Exchange Rate Volatility vs. Capital Flight**:\n",
    "   - A strong positive correlation is anticipated, as rising volatility in the ruble typically coincides with higher capital outflows due to investor uncertainty.\n",

    "## 3. Distribution Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overview**:\n",
    "- Distribution analysis provides a way to visually inspect the spread and shape of data. This is particularly important for understanding how certain variables (e.g., inflation, exchange rates) behave over time and under different economic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Metrics**:\n",
    "1. **Histograms**:\n",
    "   - Histograms will be used to visualize the distribution of key variables like **inflation**, **oil prices**, and **capital outflows**. \n",
    "   - **Purpose**: This allows for a quick visual inspection of whether the data is **normally distributed** or if there are significant skewness or outliers. In the case of inflation, for example, we might expect a right-skewed distribution due to periods of hyperinflation following major sanctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Box Plots**:\n",
    "   - Box plots will help identify the spread, central tendency, and outliers in variables such as **exchange rates** or **wages**.\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: This is particularly useful for identifying outliers in financial data that could skew the overall analysis. For instance, extreme values in oil prices during the 2022 sanctions might distort the average, and a box plot can highlight these extremes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Density Plots**:\n",
    "   - **Density plots** will provide a smoothed curve representing the distribution of data for variables like **GDP growth** or **capital flight**. \n",
    "   - **Purpose**: These plots help in understanding the probability distribution and detecting any multimodal behavior, which might suggest different regimes in the data (e.g., pre-sanctions vs. post-sanctions periods).\n",

    "## 4. Time-Series Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overview**:\n",
    "- Time-series decomposition will be used to break down key variables (e.g., **exchange rates**, **oil prices**, **inflation**) into **trend**, **seasonal**, and **residual** components. This helps in understanding underlying patterns that might not be immediately visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Metrics**:\n",
    "1. **Trend**:\n",
    "   - Identify long-term movement in variables like **inflation** or **exchange rates** over time.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Seasonality**:\n",
    "   - Capture any recurring patterns in variables such as **oil prices**, which may be affected by seasonal demand changes.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Residual**:\n",
    "   - The random component of the data, used to capture the noise or unexplained variance in the time series.\n",
