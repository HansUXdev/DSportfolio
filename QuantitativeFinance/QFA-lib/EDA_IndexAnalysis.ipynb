    "# Week-by-Week Quantitative Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Legal Disclaimer and Risk Warning\n",
    "\n",
    "This data analysis has been generated by a custom-built AI and does not represent a complete trading strategy nor should it be considered financial advice. The information presented here is a hypothetical example based solely on the data analyzed. Readers should exercise extreme caution and refrain from making any financial decisions without consulting a qualified financial advisor.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to understand that this analysis involves complex strategies such as bull spreads and bearish call spreads on leveraged assets. These strategies carry significant risks and are intended for sophisticated investors or accredited investors only, not for retail investors. The use of leveraged assets amplifies both potential gains and losses, and the combination with options strategies further increases the complexity and risk profile of these investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The author of this analysis uses additional custom indicators, not presented in this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), to further optimize entry and exit points. These proprietary indicators are not disclosed for confidentiality reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategies and allocations mentioned in this document are purely theoretical and may not be suitable for all investors. Past performance does not guarantee future results, and the financial markets involve inherent risks. Always conduct thorough research and seek professional advice before making any investment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this analysis is to optimize the timing of Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) into SPY and QQQ for long-term, tax-advantaged positions. This approach aims to build a core portfolio of these broad market ETFs over time, taking advantage of market seasonality and volatility patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Options strategies are employed for two main purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To hedge against potential downside risks in the core long-term positions.\n",
    "2. To generate supplemental income, which can be reinvested to accelerate the accumulation of shares in the core ETF positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By strategically timing entries and using options for both protection and income generation, the goal is to enhance overall returns and reduce risk compared to a simple, fixed-interval DCA approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kelly Criterion and Risk Management\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kelly Criterion is a mathematical formula used to determine the optimal size of a series of bets or investments. In this analysis, we use the Kelly Criterion to guide position sizing for each strategy component. However, it's important to note that we only use 1/3 of the calculated Kelly Fraction for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Risk Mitigation: The full Kelly Criterion can lead to aggressive position sizing, which may be too risky for most investors. Using 1/3 of the Kelly Fraction significantly reduces the risk of large drawdowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model Uncertainty: Our analysis is based on historical data and assumptions about future market behavior. By using a fraction of the Kelly Criterion, we account for potential inaccuracies in our model or unexpected market events.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Capital Preservation: A more conservative approach helps preserve capital over the long term, which is crucial for the core objective of accumulating shares in SPY and QQQ.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Volatility Smoothing: Using a reduced Kelly Fraction helps smooth out the equity curve, potentially leading to a more psychologically manageable investment experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these strategic elements - optimized DCA timing, options for hedging and income, and conservative position sizing based on a fractional Kelly Criterion - this approach aims to provide a sophisticated framework for long-term investors seeking to build significant positions in broad market ETFs while managing risk and potentially enhancing returns.\n"
