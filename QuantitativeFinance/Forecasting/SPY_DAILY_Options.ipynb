    "# Studying Daily Options on SPY Index\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we will focus on analyzing daily options on the SPY index with the goal of effectively collecting credit from selling options nearest tothe d aily pivot points (R1 or S1) or getting assigned to potentially earn premiums from put or call assignments. The primary objective is to develop a simple yet reliable forecasting model for options trading but with the added complexity of dividends and American-style options.\n",

    "## Goals\n",
    "- Develop a simple and reliable forecasting model for daily options trading on the SPY index.\n",
    "- Optimize strategies to effectively collect credit from selling options or profit from put/call assignments.\n",
    "- Enhance risk management techniques to minimize potential losses in options trading.\n",
