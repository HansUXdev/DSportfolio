    "\n",
    "The purpose of this study is to develop a simple and reliable forecasting model for options trading, specifically focusing on weekly options on the DAX index. The study aims to create a forecasting model that does not incorporate the added complexities of dividends and American-style options, making it more accessible and easier to understand for traders.\n",
