Follow the instructions below to ensure all work is structured, organized, and reproducible.\n\nGeneral Instructions:\n\nAll code and files must be saved and run in the following directory: /home/drc/Desktop/DataSciencePortfolio/QuantitativeFinance/AutoGen_EDA.\nThe CSV files required for the EDA are located in a subdirectory within the main directory. Ensure you navigate to and use these files appropriately.\nEnvironment and Tools:\n\nUse a Conda environment for running Python scripts. Create and activate the environment as needed.\nUse Python 3.8+ for all coding tasks.\nMake frequent use of shell commands such as ls, pwd, cd, mkdir, touch, cat, curl, and others as necessary for reading, writing, and editing files.\nCoding Standards:\n\nAll code written should be modular and reusable. No pseudocode or placeholders may be used at any point.\nOrganize code using proper data structures, design patterns, and algorithms.\nEnsure all code is well-documented with comments and docstrings to make it easy for junior developers to understand and follow.\nFile Organization:\n\nAll scripts, modules, and results should be organized in a coherent way:\nUse clear and descriptive filenames.\nGroup related files into subdirectories as needed (e.g., scripts, data, results, logs).\nMaintain a clean and organized directory structure. Use subdirectories for:\nScripts: All Python scripts and shell scripts.\nData: Store the raw CSV files here, along with any cleaned or transformed data files.\nResults: Save all output files, figures, and final reports.\nLogs: Keep log files for tracking execution history and debugging.\nDocumentation:\n\nCreate a README.md file in the root directory to document the project, including setup instructions, a brief project overview, and descriptions of the main scripts.\nDocument all code with clear comments explaining the logic and functionality.\nInclude docstrings for all functions and classes, specifying input parameters, return values, and any side effects.\nSpecific Tasks:\n\nSetup:\n\nCreate a Conda environment named eda_env and install the necessary packages (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn).\nInitialize the project directory structure with subdirectories for scripts, data, results, and logs.\nData Loading:\n\nWrite a script to load the CSV files from the data subdirectory. Use modular functions for loading and previewing the data.\nCheck the structure and quality of each dataset, report on any issues (missing values, incorrect data types).\nData Cleaning and Preprocessing:\n\nDevelop a script to handle data cleaning tasks (e.g., handling missing values, data type conversions, data normalization).\nEnsure that any data transformations are clearly documented and reversible if needed.\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\n\nCreate modular scripts to generate descriptive statistics and visualizations for each dataset.\nUse libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to create plots that visualize trends, distributions, and relationships.\nTime Series Analysis:\n\nWrite functions to perform stationarity tests and time series decomposition.\nUse ACF and PACF plots to analyze autocorrelations.\nForecasting Model Selection:\n\nDevelop scripts to evaluate different forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet).\nDocument the criteria for model selection and the results of each model evaluation.\nModel Training and Validation:\n\nImplement scripts to train selected forecasting models and validate their performance.\nEnsure that all models are trained on training data and evaluated using appropriate metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE).\nForecasting and Results Interpretation:\n\nGenerate forecasts using the best-performing models and visualize the results.\nInterpret the results and provide insights into the future trends of the macroeconomic indicators.\nReport Generation:\n\nCompile all findings, visualizations, and insights into a comprehensive report.\nSave the report in the results subdirectory.\nWhen to TERMINATE:\n\nTERMINATE the current task and provide feedback when you have completed the specific section of the project you are working on.\nTERMINATE if any errors are encountered that cannot be resolved with the current information or setup, and escalate the issue for further assistance.\nTERMINATE after documenting all tasks, ensuring that code is well-commented, and relevant outputs or findings are saved in the appropriate directories.\nTERMINATE once all scripts have been executed successfully, results are generated, and the final report has been compiled and saved.\nBy following these instructions, the team can ensure a structured, efficient, and scalable approach to creating the EDA, making use of modular and reusable code while maintaining clear documentation and organization."},"task_instruction":null}
