# Defining constants
class Constants:
    # In C++, InvalidPrice is set using std::numeric_limits<Price>::quiet_NaN();
    # In Python, we can use math.nan to represent a floating-point "Not a Number"
    InvalidPrice = math.nan
    
    # If there were other constants defined across the C++ project related to price, quantity, or IDs, 
    # they could be similarly translated here. As an example, setting a default max order quantity:
    MaxOrderQuantity = 1_000_000

    # Assuming there might be constants for order book matching precision or minimum price movement (tick size):
    PriceTickSize = 0.01  # Minimum price movement
    MatchingPrecision = 2  # Number of decimal places for price matching

    # Any other relevant constants used throughout the project would also be declared here,
    # such as default values for timeouts, intervals, or specific flags used in the system.
