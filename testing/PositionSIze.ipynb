    "# Quantitative Analysis of Position Sizing Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this Jupyter Notebook, we will explore and compare various position sizing methods commonly used in quantitative trading strategies. The position sizing methods under consideration are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Description | Pros | Cons | When to use | When not to use | Pros/Cons |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| Fixed fractional | This method involves betting a fixed fraction of your account on each trade. For example, you might decide to bet 1% of your account on each trade. | Easy to implement, simple to understand | Does not take into account the odds or probabilities of the trade, can lead to over-betting or under-betting in certain situations | Traders who want a simple and easy-to-implement position sizing strategy | Traders who want to take into account the odds or probabilities of the trade | Pros: easy to implement, simple to understand | Cons: does not take into account the odds or probabilities of the trade, can lead to over-betting or under-betting in certain situations |\n",
    "| Fixed ratio | This method involves betting a fixed number of units on each trade, where the size of each unit is based on the size of your account. For example, you might decide to bet 1 unit on each trade, where 1 unit is equal to 1% of your account. | Allows for more flexibility than fixed fractional, can be adjusted based on the trader's risk tolerance | Requires more calculation than fixed fractional, can still lead to over-betting or under-betting in certain situations | Traders who want more flexibility in their position sizing and are willing to do more calculations | Traders who want a simple and easy-to-implement position sizing strategy | Pros: allows for more flexibility, can be adjusted based on the trader's risk tolerance | Cons: requires more calculation, can still lead to over-betting or under-betting in certain situations |\n",
    "| Kelly criterion | This method involves betting a percentage of your account based on the odds and probabilities of the trade. The Kelly criterion is designed to maximize the long-term growth rate of an account. | Takes into account the odds and probabilities of the trade, maximizes the long-term growth rate of an account | Can lead to large swings in account balance, requires calculating the expected value and variance of the trade | Traders who want to maximize their long-term growth rate and are willing to take on more risk | Traders who are not comfortable with large swings in account balance | Pros: takes into account the odds and probabilities of the trade, maximizes the long-term growth rate of an account | Cons: can lead to large swings in account balance, requires calculating the expected value and variance of the trade |\n",
    "| Optimal f | This method involves calculating the optimal fraction of your account to bet based on the expected value and variance of the trade. The optimal f formula is: f = (W - L) / (b - 1) where W is the probability of winning, L is the probability of losing, and b is the odds received on a winning bet. | Takes into account the expected value and variance of the trade, can be adjusted based on the trader's risk tolerance | Requires calculating the expected value and variance of the trade, can be complex to calculate | Traders who want to take into account the expected value and variance of the trade and are willing to do more calculations | Traders who are not comfortable with calculating the expected value and variance of the trade | Pros: takes into account the expected value and variance of the trade, can be adjusted based on the trader's risk tolerance | Cons: requires calculating the expected value and variance of the trade, can be complex to calculate |\n",
    "| Volatility-based | This method involves adjusting the size of your positions based on the volatility of the asset you are trading. For example, you might decide to bet a smaller percentage of your account on assets with higher volatility. | Takes into account the volatility of the asset being traded, can be adjusted based on the trader's risk tolerance | Requires calculating the volatility of the asset, can be difficult to accurately calculate the volatility of the asset | Traders who want to take into account the volatility of the asset being traded and are willing to do more calculations | Traders who are not comfortable with calculating the volatility of the asset | Pros: takes into account the volatility of the asset, can be adjusted based on the trader's risk tolerance | Cons: requires calculating the volatility of the asset, can be difficult to accurately calculate the volatility of the asset |\n",

    "5. **Volatility-based Position Sizing**: We will adjust the position size based on the volatility of the asset being traded.\n",
